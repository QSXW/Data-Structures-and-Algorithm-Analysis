# Data-Structures-and-Algorithm-Analysis
- Highly optimized Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis.
- When programming, I would try to get rid of the shackles of textbooks. I am not saying that those codes written in textbooks are terrible. It's simply not enough better and excessively common. If using a sentence to modify, I would say - "Those codes may be just the most fundamental implementation of data-structures-and-algorithm-analysis' theory, which doesn't consider the program's **efficiency and memory allocation** that is extremely significant, especially if you're using `C/C++`. Of course, `Java` would be another situation. I have few used ever `Java` worked for my programming, tho, everyone tells me that you don't need to ponder because Java will allocate automatically.
